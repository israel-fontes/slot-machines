    <div class="paragrafo"><p>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is a Japanese tactical role-playing game for the Game Boy Advance developed by Intelligent<br>
         Systems and published by Nintendo. It was released on October 7, 2004 in Japan, and was later localized and released on May 23, 2005 in North America.<br> 
         It is the eighth game in the Fire Emblem series, the third and final game in <br>
         the series to be released for the Game Boy Advance and the second game in the series to be released outside Japan.<br>
        The game builds on the game mechanics used in the previous two Game Boy Advance Fire Emblem titles; Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade and Fire Emblem: The Blazing Blade; but takes place on a
         different continent.<br> Set on the continent of Magvel, the plot focuses on royal twins
         Princess Eirika and Prince Ephraim as they investigate why a longtime ally has chosen to invade their nation's borders and the sudden appearance of monsters all over Magvel.</p>
